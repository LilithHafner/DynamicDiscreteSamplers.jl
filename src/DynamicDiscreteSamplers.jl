#===== Overview  ======

# Objective

This package provides a discrete random sampler with the following key properties
 - Exact: sampling probability exactly matches provided weights
 - O(1) worst case expected runtime for sampling
        (though termination only guaranteed probabilistically)
 - O(1) worst case amortized update time to change the weight of any element
        (an individual update may take up to O(n))
 - O(n) space complexity
 - O(n) construction time
 - Fast constant factor in practice. Typical usage has a constant factor of tens of clock
        cycles and pathological usage has a constant factor of thousands of clock cycles.


# Brief implementation overview

Weights are are divided into levels according to their exponents. To sample, first sample a
level and then sample an element within that level.


# Definition of terms

v::Float64 aka weight
    An entry in a Weights object set with `w[i] = v`, retrieved with `v = w[i]`.
exponent::UInt64
    The exponent of a weight is `reinterpret(UInt64, weight) >> 52`.
    Note that this is _not_ the same as `Base.exponent(weight)` nor
    `reinterpret(UInt64, weight) & Base.exponent_mask(Float64)`.
level
    All the weights in a Weights object that have the same exponent.
significand::UInt64
    The significand of a weight is `reinterpret(UInt64, weight) << 11 | 0x8000000000000000`.
    Ranges from 0x8000000000000000 for 1.0 to 0xfffffffffffff800 for 1.9999...
    The ratio of two weights with the same exponent is the ratio of their significands.
significand_sum::UInt128
    The sum of the significands of the weights in a given level.
    Is 0 for empty levels and otherwise ranges from widen(0x8000000000000000) to
    widen(0xfffffffffffff800) * length(weights).
weight
    Refers to the relative likely hood of an event. Weights are like probabilities except
    they do not need to sum to one. In this codebase, the term "weight" is used to refer to
    four things: the weight of an element relative to all the other elements in in a
    Weights object; the weight of an element relative to the other elements in its level;
    the weight of a level relative to the other levels as defined by level_weights; and the
    weight of a level relative to the other levels as defined by significand_sums.


# Implementation and data structure overview

Weights are normal, non-negative Float64s. They are divided into levels according to their
exponents. Each level has a weight which is the exact sum of the weights in that level. We
can't represent this sum exactly as a Float64 so we represent it as significand_sum::UInt128
which is the sum of the significands of the weights in that level. To get the level's weight,
compute big(significand_sum)<<exponent.

## Sampling
Sampling with BigInt weights is not efficient so each level also has an approximate weight
which is a UInt64. These approximate weights are computed as exact_weight<<global_shift+1 if
exact_weight is nonzero, and 0 otherwise. global_shift is a constant maintained by the
sampler so that the sum of the approximate weights is less than 2^64 and greater than 2^32.

To sample a level, we pick a random UInt64 between 1 and the sum of the approximate weights.
Then use linear search to find the level that corresponds to (with the highest weight levels
at the start of that search). This picks a level with probability according to approximate
weights which is not quite accurate. We correct for this by adding a small probability
rejection. If the linear search lands on the edge of a level (which can happen at most
2046/2^32 of the time), we consider rejecting. That process need not be fast but is O(1) and
utilizes significand_sum directly.

Sampling an element within a level is straightforward rejection sampling which is O(1)
because all rejection probabilities are less than or equal to 1/2.
